Toy code and proof-of-concepts, not for production

---------------------------

### Introduction

This repo must never see the light of day. The code may move to production, but this repo will never go public!

#### So there's a chance this repo might go public?

There is no chance this repo will ever go public.

### Notes 

There are no protections on any branches, be kind, rewind.

Please work on different tasks in different branches and be descriptive so we know where to find which toys.
